## Problem Overview 
Cryptocurrencies, hailed by some as the future of money, has captured a lot of attention lately as one of its most coveted variant, Bitcoin, recorded several all-time highs in the last couple of months. As a result of its record-breaking performance, more and more questions are now being asked. Is it a good or safe haven investment? Where will it go from here? Will it eventually replace cash and become the future medium of exchange?
  
Now, although it'll be some time before we truly know the future place (and role) of cryptocurrencies, many are already using it as a means of investment. Considered to have a good upside, they are attracting more and more investors who are looking for alternative investments to diversify their portfolio.
  
But, how safe is it to invest in cryptocurrencies? In this project, we will attempt to analyse its volatility (which is a big topic of cryptocurrency) using poisson processes.
